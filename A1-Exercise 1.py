Exercise 1: Coding is Cool
Fill in the blanks in the Python code below to output the phrase "Coding is Cool" 
to the console using variables and string concatenation.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
'''
word1 = "Coding" #Variable 1 is called word1 and consist of the value "Coding".
word2 = "is" #Variable 2 is called word2 and consist of the value "is".
word3 = "cool" #Variable 3 is called word3 and consist of the value "cool".
#String concatenation works by using the "+" symbol to add the strings together.
print (word1+ " " + word2+ " "+ word3) #Print was used to print the 3 variables stated above.
'''
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The quotation marks were used as a space to separate the words.
If the quotation marks weren't used, the outcome would be CodingisCool instead of Coding is Cool
