num1 = 8 #Variable 1 is called num1 and contains the integer value 8.
num2 = 10 #Variable 2 is called num2 and contains the integer value 10
sum = num1 + num2 #Variable 3 is called sum and has the formula to get the sum of num1 and num2.
print (sum) #Print was used to print the Variable sum. This shows the result of 8+10 which is 18.
